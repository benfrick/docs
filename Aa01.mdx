![The default landing page for the Kentik v4 portal can be set to the Network Explorer module.](/images/NE-Main-891h1120w.png)

For information on browser support and login procedures for the v4 portal, see [Kentik Portals](/v0ab11)

## Portal Sections

The Kentik v4 portal is primarily comprised of modules — some referred to as
"workflows" — that are each designed to help you efficiently access information
related to a specific networking use case.

The KB's Use Cases page
(accessed from the top of the left sidebar's `Contents` tab) enables you to
match — based on type and/or role — your organization's use cases to
corresponding modules in the Kentik portal. 

In the [Portal Main Menu](#portal-main-menu), a
selection of the most common and general modules — described in
[Featured Overview](/featured-overview) — are featured at the top of the
left column:

- [Alerting](/alerting)
- [Journeys](/journeys)
- [Kentik Map](/kentik-map)
- [Library](/library)
- [My Kentik Portal](/my-kentik-portal)
- [Observation Deck](/observation-deck)

The remaining modules are categorized into the following sections, which each
contain multiple modules:

### Settings

Administrative controls that enable you to tailor your Kentik
setup so that it works effectively for both you and your organization (see
[Settings Overview](/settings-overview)):

- Organization and user settings are available via drop-down menus from the
  navbar (see [Org & User Overview](/org-user-overview)).
- Settings in categories such as Data Sources, Alerting, Agents, Network Metadata, and Data Enrichment (see
  [Settings Categories](/settings-overview)) are accessed from the Settings
  page or the `Settings` submenu on the [Portal Main Menu](#portal-main-menu).

### Core

A comprehensive view of the day-to-day operations of your network in
environments such as cloud, data center, WAN, and/or campus (see
[Core Overview](/core-overview)). The Core section includes the following
[Core Modules](/core-overview):

- [Network Explorer](/network-explorer)
- [Data Explorer](/data-explorer)
- [Capacity Planning](/capacity-planning)
- [Insights](/insights)

### Synthetics

Kentik's Synthetics
workflows enable you to continuously monitor network performance so you can
uncover and correct issues before they impact customer experience (see
[Synthetics Overview](/synthetics-overview)). This proactive testing is
enabled by Kentik software agents (ksynth), including both public agents
(available to all Kentik customers) and private agents (available only to your
organization). The ping and traceroute tests performed with these agents
generate key metrics (latency, jitter, and loss) that are evaluated for
network health and performance. The Synthetics section includes the following
[Synthetics Modules](/synthetics-overview):

- [Synthetics Dashboard](/synthetics-dashboard)
- [Test Control Center](/test-control-center)
- [Agent Management](/agent-management)
- [BGP Route Viewer](/bgp-route-viewer)
- [State of the Internet](/state-of-the-internet)

### Network Monitoring System

Kentik NMS provides a base layer of visibility for your network by
discovering and monitoring your network infrastructure (see
[NMS Overview](/nms-overview)). Our NMS implementation supports
traditional use cases like detecting devices that go down, graphing interface
statistics, sending alerts, and creating dashboards. The NMS section includes
the following modules (see [NMS Documentation](/nms-overview)):

- [NMS Dashboard](/nms-dashboard)
- [Metrics Explorer](/metrics-explorer)
- [Query Assistant](/query-assistant)
- [NMS Devices](/nms-devices)
- [NMS Interfaces](/nms-interfaces)

### Edge

Modules that enable
Ops/Engineering to understand both network utilization and costs related to
traffic coming from or going to external networks (see [Edge
Overview](/edge-overview)). The Edge section includes the following [Edge
Modules](/edge-overview):

- [Traffic Engineering](/traffic-engineering)
- [Connectivity Costs](/connectivity-costs)
- [Discover Peers](/discover-peers)

### Protect

security use cases (see [Protect Overview](/protect-overview)), enabling
you to defend your network, including detecting anomalies and responding
against DDoS and other threats. The Protect section includes the following
[Protect Workflows](/protect-overview):

- [DDos Defense](/ddos-defense)
- [Mitigations](/mitigations)
- [Botnet & Threat Analysis](/botnet-threat-analysis)
- [RPKI Analysis](/rpki-analysis)

The DDoS Defense
and Mitigations modules work in tandem with Alerting, which is accessed via
the `Featured` section of the main menu.

### Service Provider

A section
focused on enabling service providers (e.g. ISPs) to understand requirements
and performance related to services they provide to customers and subscribers
(see [Service Provider Overview](/service-provider-overview)). The Service
Provider section includes the following

## Portal Page Structure

The basic structure of most portal pages is covered here.

### Portal Page Layout

The main elements of the v4 portal layout are basically similar across most (but
not all) pages:

- **Navbar**: A black horizontal navigation bar at the top of the page includes a
  set of elements that provide links to important portal functions (see [Portal
  Navbar](#portal-navbar).
- **Subnav**: A silver (Light theme) or dark gray (Dark theme)
  horizontal navigation bar below the navbar includes UI elements that vary
  depending on the page (see [Portal Subnav](#portal-subnav).
- **Main menu**: An overlay that
  opens from the hamburger icon at the left of the navbar, which provides the user
  with easy access to all of the portal's modules and its most frequently accessed
  pages (see [Portal Main Menu](#portal-main-menu).
- **Main content**: The main content area
  displays page components such as visualizations, tables, controls, and sidebars.
  These components vary widely depending on the current page.

(see [Settings Overview](/settings-overview)) or the `Settings` submenu on
the [Portal Main Menu](#portal-main-menu).

#### Product Updates

The `Product Updates` modal, which pops up from the `Product Updates` button in
the [Portal Navbar](#portal-navbar), contains the following UI elements:

- **Product updates**: A button (at the right of the title) that opens Kentik's
  [Product Updates](https://new.kentik.com) page in new browser tab.

  represent a recent article in the product blog on Kentik's website.

#### Product Article Cards

Each article card in the `Product updates` popup includes the following
elements:

### Portal Subnav

The subnav is a silver (Light theme) or dark gray (Dark theme) horizontal strip
below the navbar, which includes the following UI elements:

- **Breadcrumbs**: Indicates where you are in the portal and includes links that
  let you navigate up to a higher level.
- **Page-specific buttons**: A set of
  buttons found in the subnav of many but not all portal modules. These menus
  provide access to actions that are specific to a given page, such as refreshing
  the page's data, sharing the page's content, creating a dashboard panel or saved
  view from the page, or adjusting query parameters that determine the results
  shown on the page. For more information about the subnav buttons on a specific
  page, see the subnav topic in that page's KB article.

Several module landing pages have no subnav.
