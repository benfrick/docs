This article provides a basic introduction to the Kentik v4 portal:

![The default landing page for the Kentik v4 portal can be set to the Network Explorer module.](/images/NE-Main-891h1120w.png)

<Aside>For information on browser support and login procedures for the v4 portal, see [Kentik Portals](/v0ab11)</Aside>

## Portal Sections

The Kentik v4 portal is primarily comprised of modules — some referred to as
“workflows” — that are each designed to help you efficiently access information
related to a specific networking use case.

<Aside type="tip"> The KB's Use Cases page
(accessed from the top of the left sidebar's `Contents` tab) enables you to
match — based on type and/or role — your organization's use cases to
corresponding modules in the Kentik portal. </Aside>

In the [Portal Main Menu](#portal-main-menu), a
selection of the most common and general modules — described in
[Featured Overview](/featured-overview) — are featured at the top of the
left column:

- [Alerting](/alerting)
- [Journeys](/journeys)
- [Kentik Map](/kentik-map)
- [Library](/library)
- [My Kentik Portal](/my-kentik-portal)
- [Observation Deck](/observation-deck)

The remaining modules are categorized into the following sections, which each
contain multiple modules:

## Portal Search

The portal's search features are covered here.

### Portal Search UI

The portal’s search functionality is implemented as a modal that opens from the
`Search` field in the main navbar or by using [Search Keyboard Shortcuts](#search-keyboard-shortcuts). The
`Search` modal, which you can access from any portal page, includes the
following elements:

- **Search**: A field, at the top of the modal, where you enter the text on which
to search. The search is incremental, so you need not press return after
entering the term.
- **Try searching for** (question mark icon): A list that pops
up when you hover on the icon. The list shows various things that you can search
for and the properties you can enter to search for them. The list includes both
network entities (e.g. ASNs, IP addresses, interfaces, etc.) and Kentik-specific
constructs (e.g. cost groups, dashboards, etc.).
<Aside type="tip">The same
list is displayed in the **Search Results Tab** when no text is entered in the
`Search` field.</Aside>
- **Tabs**: The main display area of the modal, below the `Search`
field, includes three tabs (see [Portal Search Tabs](#portal-search-tabs).

### Portal Search Tabs

The lozenge-like buttons at the top of the `Search` modal's main display area
enable you to switch between three tabs:

- **Favorites**: A list of portal views you’ve favorited (see [Favorites Tab](#favorites-tab).
The number of favorites appears in parentheses in the tab head.
- **Recents**: A list of your recently viewed dashboards and saved views (see [Recents Tab](#recents-tab).
The number of recents appears in parentheses in the tab head.
- **Search Results**: A list of search results for the term entered in the `Search` field (see
[Search Results Tab](#search-results-tab).

The `Search Results` tab displays as soon as you begin entering text in the
`Search` field. If you haven't yet entered any text, the tab displayed when you
first open the `Search` modal depends on whether you've favorited or recently
visited any portal locations:

If you've designated any favorites in the portal, the `Favorites` tab will
display. If you don't have any favorites, your `Recents` tab will display. If you
haven't visited any pages recently, the `Search Results` tab will be visible.

#### Favorites Tab

The `Favorites` tab on the `Search` modal provides you with a convenient place
to bookmark portal locations that you visit often.

### Favorites Tab UI

The `Favorites` tab contains a list of every portal location that you have
designated as a favorite. The list is divided into three categories:
`Dashboards`, `Saved Views`, and `Screens & Workflows`. Click any listed
bookmark to navigate directly to that
location.

![A list of all your favorite portal locations.](/images/PO-Search_favorites_tab-624h912w.png)

### Manage Favorites

A portal location (e.g. page) is indicated as a favorite by the star icon, which
will be solid in locations that are already favorites, and otherwise outlined.
Click the icon to toggle the designation on/off. The icon appears to the left of
the page name in the following portal locations:

- In the title bar of the page itself
- On the [Library List](/library) (dashboards and saved views only)
- In the `Saved Views` drawer on the Data Explorer page (saved views only)
- In the `Search` modal, on the `Favorites` tab and **Recents Tab**.

<Aside>Any changes to favorites made in the
Search modal are not reflected in the modal until the next time it's opened.</Aside>

#### Recents Tab

The `Recents` tab includes two tables listing recently visited views, one for
dashboards and the other for saved views. Both lists are in reverse
chronological order. Click a listed view to go directly to that
page.![A list of recently visited dashboards and saved views.](/images/PO-Recent_tab-440h904w.png)Each
table row includes the following elements:

- **Favorite**: A star icon that indicates whether the view is designated as a
favorite (solid) or not (outlined). Click the icon to toggle the
designation.
- **Name**: The name of the view.
- **Description**: The description text
(if any) provided when the view was created or edited, which appears below the
name.
- **Last accessed**: How recently the view was accessed (measured in minutes,
hours, days, weeks, or months).

#### Search Results Tab

Whenever the Search field is empty, the `Search Results` tab displays the
`Try searching for` list (see [Portal Search UI](#portal-search-ui).

![](/images/PO-Try_searching-552h608w.png)

As you enter text in the `Search` field, the
search engine starts looking for matches and the `Try searching for` list is
replaced with the following elements:

- **Results list**: A table at the left listing results that are grouped into
sections by category (see [Results List](#results-list).
- **Type list**: A list at the right
of all the categories into which the returned results are grouped (see [Type
List](#type-list), and showing the number of results in each category.
- **See KB results**:
A link that opens this KB in a new browser tab, where a `Search` page will be
populated with KB results from the portal search term. The page will default to
results from the v4 Portal KB, but you can use the tabs to switch to results
from the Platform KB or the (deprecated) v3 Portal KB.

![](/images/PO-Search_KB_results-480h672w.png)

### Results List

The first row of the `Results` list is a link to [**Journeys**](/journeys),
where a new journey will be started using the entered search term. The remaining
results are grouped by the type of portal view to which each result links (e.g.
Interfaces, Synthetic Tests, Dashboards, etc.).

![](/images/PO-Search_results_list-720h576w.png)

If more than five results return for a given type, the `+ more` button will
appear at the bottom right of the group, showing how many more results returned
for that type. Click the button to expand the group to show the remaining
results.

<Aside type="tip">The display of any group in the `Results` list may be
toggled on/off by clicking the corresponding element in the **Type List**.</Aside>

### Type List

When you begin entering text in the `Search` field, the `Type` list at the right
of the `Search Results` tab is populated with a row for each type that is
present in the returned results. Clicking on a given row will show/hide the
corresponding group of results in the `Results` list.
![](/images/PO-Search_type_list-240h192w.png)

The row for each type includes the following
elements:

- **Type**: The name of the type (Dashboards, Interfaces, etc.).
- **Count**: A lozenge indicating the number of results in the corresponding group of the
`Results` list.

<Aside>If the group corresponding to a given type is
hidden in the `Results` list then the lozenge will be gray; otherwise it will be
blue.</Aside>

Two additional controls, found below the `Type` list, also affect what's visible
in the `Results` list:

- **All**: A button that shows all groups in the `Results` list.
- **None**: A button that hides all groups in the `Results` list.

#### Search Keyboard Shortcuts

The `Search` modal includes keyboard shortcuts for the commands in the table
below.
